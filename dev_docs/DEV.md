## pytest plugin

https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/plugins.html#using-plugins

If a plugin is installed, pytest automatically finds and integrates it, there is no need to activate it.


If you want to find out which plugins are active in your environment you can type:

```
pytest --trace-config
```
